# Assignment 6 High Fidelity Prototype: UI
# By Adam Kaba

## Description

This project is to visualize the improvements I made to delish and show what they would look like on a high fidelity prototype. The goal of the improvements is to make the site more easily navigatable by improving the menu, and making it clear. Some issues with the site were that:  
  
1.The relevant buttons, like the menu are not where you would expect at first. When you load into the site, the menu button is at the bottom left and moves to the top right on scroll down.  
2. Consistency is pretty bad, theres a 2x2 picture menu, followed by 1 big picture, followed by a 1x4 picture menu, followed by 2 medium pictures, seemingly for no reason.  
3. The figure ground contrast is iffy, the plain white background and the edge of the picture blend together a bit, not awful but a little weird.  

These screenshots demonstrate in order, the home page, selection menu, and recipe page.

## Impression test findings

-"I like the layout from the dark scheme the best, the contrast between the blue and gray is nice."
-"The blue in the first design looks a little dark"
-"The last design is interesting, maybe replace the first one with that and make it the regular one."

## Design

The design I went for tried to closely mimic the already existing color scheme of the website, I wanted the page to be fairly light with blue accents. Thats why with the exception of the dark mode, the background is mostly a light color while the menus and all pop outs remain blue. The design screen is an Iphone 11 Pro Max, just for simplicity. Most of the font is in Montserrat, and is differentiated by bold or italic letters. With the exception of the logo, which is in Montserrat Alternates, this is because it somewhat matches the already existing font of the site, and recreating the font rather than uploading a screenshot allows me to change the background color easier. I tried to give every button a border around it to differentiate it from its surroundings. I created the third layout in a way that keeps the same tones but has more *color* so to speak.
