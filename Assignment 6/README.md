# Assignment 6 High Fidelity Prototype: UI
# By Adam Kaba

## Description

This project is to visualize the improvements I made to delish and show what they would look like on a high fidelity prototype. The goal of the improvements is to make the site more easily navigatable by improving the menu, and making it clear. Some issues with the site were that  
1.The relevant buttons, like the menu are not where you would expect at first. When you load into the site, the menu button is at the bottom left and moves to the top right on scroll down.  
2. Consistency is pretty bad, theres a 2x2 picture menu, followed by 1 big picture, followed by a 1x4 picture menu, followed by 2 medium pictures, seemingly for no reason.  
3. The figure ground contrast is iffy, the plain white background and the edge of the picture blend together a bit, not awful but a little weird.  

These screenshots demonstrate in order, the home page, selection menu, and recipe page.

## Impression test findings

-"I like the layout from the dark scheme the best, the contrast between the blue and gray is nice."
-"The blue in the first design looks a little dark"
-"The last design is interesting, maybe replace the first one with that and make it the regular one."
