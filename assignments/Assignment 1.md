# DH 110 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
## By Adam Kaba



Severity will be rated by the following criteria:
-------------------------------------------------
1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project  
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority  
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority

### Website 1: [Delish](https://www.delish.com/)

*Delish is a website to go too for all things food. On the website things such as news, trends, popular restaurants, cooking tips, and even products to buy. Many people come to this site in order to find a recipe or maybe get inspiration.*

**Evaluation**:

*The delish webpage isnt awful, however some very weird design choices hold it back from being intuitive and clean like the rest of its competitors. For example the image of the main page looks like the bottom was cut off, its not, thats exactly how the page appears on the computer. The website is confusing to navigate for a first time user, and once you figure out how to navigate it, it's still difficult to find what you're looking for.*

|Heuristic & Meaning| Heuristic Evaluation | Recommendation| Severity Rating|
|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Visibility of System Status**: The system should always give you an indication of what is going on once you perform an action |The system does a good job letting you know an option is selected, however it's not exactly clear what on the screen is an option to choose from. | The website whould have clickable items in a different color, or have them stand out somehow |2|
| **Match between system & real world**: The system should follow intuition from real life conventions. This includes using familliar words and making the system flow logically. |The system does a good job following real life conventions, however some of the lingo used might be a bit too colloquial for non young adults to understand. Maybe intentional to cater to audience | The website should tone down the wording used, depending on who the catered audience is |1|
| **User control & freedom**: The user should be allowed to navigate the interface freely and be in control. The user should not get locked into certain actions and become stuck.| From the main page, the interface is somewhat hard to navigate. Once you figure out where to go, you don't have much control over what you're shown. |The website should include filters to pick and choose what you are looking at in a selection of items. Search bars should also be impelented on pages such as recipes|3|
| **Consistency & standards**: The system should function as the user expects based on their experiences with other systems. The system should follow intuitive conventions used by other systems |The system functions very differently than one would expect from a simillar system. The main page is a giant picture with the menu bar at the bottom-left. The search bar and any options are hidden until you click the menu button.|The search bar should be implemented on the main page for ease of access. The menu should also be at one of the top corners from the start, rather than when you slow down. |3|
| **Recognition rather than recall**: The user should not have to struggle to remember what elements and actions do. They should be able to easily recognize and recall info on screen.|Due to the websites different design choices, navigating the website requires users to learn it's specific layout, rather than being able to understand what their looking at.|The website should make the users options, such as what they can click, more clear. Along with this it would be beneficial to standardize the layout|2|
| **Error Prevention**: Aside from error troubleshooting, the system should prevent errors from occuring due to user actions in the first place.  | The website does a good job at preventing errors |None needed| 1 |
| **Flexibility and efficiency of use**: Shortcuts, or simillar methods should be implemented such that experienced users can speed up interactions. These methods should be hidden from beginner users so the system works well for new users as well as experienced users.|The only method of a shortcut present on the website is a search bar.|While not super important as, people aren't using a website to conduct a task itself, adding tags and filters to recipies and items such as(*Breakfast*, *meat*, *vegetarian*) would speed up user interactions significantly. |2|
| **Aesthetic and minimalist design**: The interface should not have elements distracting users from the important/ relevant information. The pertinent info should be displayed prominently and should not have to compete with other elements for attention.  |The website is very minimalist and the aesthetic is nice, however the pertinent info is not displayed prominently. All food items are jumbled together and not really grouped at all. The display shows a changing amount of columns, so navigating the recipe section feels weird. Furthermore the menu options could be combined to be more concise.|The different information should be listed under categories and separated. Having something like a michelada next to a stir-fry reciple, jumbles the information presented up. There's no need for three shop options in the menu when it's the same shop but different product, they should be combined into one option to be concise. The images also shouldn't be 50x bigger than the text. |3|
| **Help users with errors**: Error messages should be explained in common language, they should state the problem and offer solutions to fix it. There shouldnt be any code or hexadecimal error numbers. |The error messages are explained clearly from my experience. |None needed |1|
| **Help and documentation**: The system shouldn't need extra explainations, however if it does, help and proper steps for the user to take in order to complete a task should be clearly documented and listed. The list should be concise and the user should be able to follow instructions step by step and arrive at their intended result.|There is no clear way to get to a help section. If you type help into the search bar, you are given every article with the word help contained in it, not helpful at all. |The website should add a help/assistance section at the bottom of the menu|3|
