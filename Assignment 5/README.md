# DH-110 Assignment 5
# By Adam Kaba

## Project Description
The project aims to alleviate difficulties arising with searching for specific recipes to fit their needs. The target users are college students and adults who either have an interest in cooking or have guests over & want to serve dishes. The target users also include those who want to keep up to date with seasonal trends, news, and find creative & innovative recipes to experiment and expand their palate with. Based on prior user research, the features that would solve difficulties with recipe searching are:  
  
  1. **Improved Search** - Searching on the website provides helpful results, such as possible recipes. Potentially irrelevant info will not be present, or at least displayed further down
  2. **Streamlined Menu** - Menu is clear and concise, lists selections very clearly with no redundancies.
  3. **Selection Filters** - Upon being given results to choose from, a menu of filters appears on the side in order to add or remove possible selections based on the type of meal being looked for.

Full prototype can be viewed on figma [here](https://www.figma.com/file/xkNZRYtvLpQJCXd0F8JhMV/DH110-Low-Fidelity-Prototype?node-id=0%3A1)

Flow is designed so that from the home menu, users can either search for a recipe or select a type of recipe from a menu. From either the menu or the search bar,the user will be brought to a list of recipes that correspond with the selected criteria. Upon viewing the list of recipes, there will be a filter in order to add or remove options based on the specifics desired. Once a filter is selected, it will display a similar page of only recipes matching the specified criteria. Upon selecting a recipe option they will be brought to a page for the specific recipe, containing all the necessary info and the instructions themselves. The user personas in mind for this flow are a college student who wants to cook a relatively quick dinner; and an adult who wants to cook a meal to impress her guests when they come over.

## Testing
Tasks: 
1. Search for a recipe for guests that serves 6-10 people.
2. Search for a chicken dish that takes 45 minutes to prepare

Two tests were conducted due to an error in the first test that messed up the recording. A user attempted to type something into the search bar, but since its not functioning, they hit a hotkey which interrupted the test. It's worth noting that this user took a different pathway than intended, using the search function for a guests recipe rather than using the for guests menu option. Based on this I fixed the flow of the filters, as I had one filter available for each pathway.
  
The second tester completed the tasks very successfully with minor issues. A slight issue arose due to the fact that the system is barebones, however the user still took the intended pathways both times. One thing of note is that this user did not use the filter option when searching for a chicken dish. However they attempted to before finding the option without the filter setting as you can see by the mouse in the video. The user still completed the desired task.

## Reflection

Creating a low fidelity prototype was fun. I decided to create my prototype using figma, which was the biggest learning curve for me as I had to teach myself the program first while thinking about the layout simultaneously. If I were to do this over again the first time, it would've been much easier to just draw everything out. However if I had to repeat this again in the future, I would use figma again, as it's easy to create the wireflow and conduct user testing. However I think trying to conduct testing of the low fidelity prototype is somewhat difficult, just because the system is fairly barebones. It's hard to explain to the user how to navigate the system. For example with the search option, the first time I conducted the test the user attempted to search, which ended up hitting some hotkeys and messed up the recording. For the test posted above, I had to tell the user to just imagine they searched for the topic.  It's a bit nonspecific so it's hard to pinpoint.
  
During the first test that messed up, the user used the search function for both options which isn't exactly wrong, however it wasnt exactly the intended pathway. I also had to change the interaction as sometimes just hovering over an option would select it. However I dont think there's anything to really change as far as the layout goes rather than just make sure that each feature leads to the result it should.
