# DH-110 Assignment 5
# By Adam Kaba

## Project Description
The project aims to alleviate difficulties arising with searching for specific recipes to fit their needs. The target users are college students and adults who either have an interest in cooking or have guests over & want to serve dishes. The target users also include those who want to keep up to date with seasonal trends, news, and find creative & innovative recipes to experiment and expand their palate with. Based on prior user research, the features that would solve difficulties with recipe searching are:  
  
  1. **Improved Search** - Searching on the website provides helpful results, such as possible recipes. Potentially irrelevant info will not be present, or at least displayed further down
  2. **Streamlined Menu** - Menu is clear and concise, lists selections very clearly with no redundancies.
  3. **Selection Filters** - Upon being given results to choose from, a menu of filters appears on the side in order to add or remove possible selections based on the type of meal being looked for.

Full prototype can be viewed on figma [here] (https://www.figma.com/file/xkNZRYtvLpQJCXd0F8JhMV/DH110-Low-Fidelity-Prototype?node-id=0%3A1)

Flow is designed so that from the home menu, users can either search for a recipe or select a type of recipe from a menu. From either the menu or the search bar,the user will be brought to a list of recipes that correspond with the selected criteria. Upon viewing the list of recipes, there will be a filter in order to add or remove options based on the specifics desired. Once a filter is selected, it will display a similar page of only recipes matching the specified criteria. Upon selecting a recipe option they will be brought to a page for the specific recipe, containing all the necessary info and the instructions themselves.

## Testing
Tasks: 
1. Search for a recipe for guests that serves 6-10 people.
2. Search for a chicken dish that takes 45 minutes to prepare

The tester completed the tasks very successfully with minor issues. A slight issue arose due to the fact that the search bar isnt actually functioning, however the user still took the intended pathways both times.
