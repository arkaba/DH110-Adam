# DH-110 Assignment 2 Usability Testing

## Introduction
The website being tested is www.delish.com. Delish is a website to go to for all things food. The website contains imformation on things such as news, trends, popular restaurants, cooking tips, and even products to buy. Many people come to this site in order to find a recipe, buy things, or just to see whats in season and maybe get some inspiration. A usability test will be conducted to see how easy users find the system to navigate, and the ease with which they can complete tasks. In addition we will also look into users sentiments regarding the site

A usability test is intended to determine the extent an interface facilitates a user’s ability to complete routine tasks. Typically the test is conducted with a group of potential users either in a usability lab, remotely (using e-meeting software and telephone connection), or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to complete a series of routine tasks. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement to the web site. 

This test was conducted by Adam Kaba, a student at UCLA. The study was conducted to test the usability and accessibility of delish.com. The participants face and voice were captured via the users laptop webcam and mic. The study took place over zoom, where the meeting was recorded and where the participants screen was shared. In total, what was captured was the users face, voice, and laptop screen.

## Methodology
Session
[Describe how the participants were recruited. Describe the individual sessions – length of time and what happened during those sessions. Explain what the participant was asked to do and what happened post test session. Describe any pre- or post-test questionnaires. Include the subjective and overall questionnaires in the attachments’ section.]

The participant was recruited from a list of friends in the same age range as the websites apparent target audience. The participant was informed of the test and it's logistics via text message. The session lasted approximately 25 minutes. During the session, the test administrator explained the process and asked the participant to answer background and pre-test questions located on the google form. The administrator read aloud the tasks for the user to accomplish on the website.

After each task, the moderator checked boxes of information off if the participant was able to find said information on the website.


After completion of all tasks, the administrator asked the participant to rate the interface and ease of use on a 7-point Likert Scale with a scale from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. Post-task scenario subjective measures can be seen on the google form and included: 
•	How easy it was to find the information from the home page.
•	How much time the tasks took.
•	How useful the website is for each task.
•	How likely they are to perform each task.


In addition, the administrator asked the participants the following overall website questions to gauge System Usability:
How much do you disagree with the following statementson a 7-point Likert Scale with a scale from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree:
•	I think that I would like to use this website frequentlyz
•	I found the website unnecessarily complex.
•	I thought the website was easy to use. 
•	I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this website.
•	I found the various functions in this website were well integrated.

•	I found the website very cumbersome to use.
•	I felt very confident using the website.

## Reflection

I feel the test period went fairly well, it was a new experience for me going off a script and instructing someone what to do. I learned that it's pretty hard to find a balance of not helping them too much, especially when you know how the site is supposed to be navigated. I think the process such as the tasks and questions and answers went by fairly smoothly. However I feel like my reading off the script needs to be practiced a little bit more. If I were to conduct this again, I would largely do the same thing. Except now that I have another perspective on where unfamilliar users struggle, I might change the tasks to include different specifics such as specific sections or collections of lists. Users seem to struggle with the menu interface, it's not clearly labled and is slightly more overcomplicated than needed causing confusion. The search bar often leads to irrelevant results, and overarching selections such as "Pastas" are hard to find.
