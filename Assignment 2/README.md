# DH-110 Assignment 2 Usability Testing

## Introduction
[Include and introduction about the Web site or application and the purpose of the site.]
For example:
AIDS.gov serves as an information gateway to drive traffic to Federal domestic HIV/AIDS information and resources. AIDS.gov provides a central repository of information across government resources providing users easy access to federal information resources.

A usability test is intended to determine the extent an interface facilitates a user’s ability to complete routine tasks. Typically the test is conducted with a group of potential users either in a usability lab, remotely (using e-meeting software and telephone connection), or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to complete a series of routine tasks. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement to the web site. 

[Provide a summary about who conducted the test and what they used. Include a brief summary about the session data.]
For example: 
The AIDS.gov usability engineers conducted an onsite usability test using a live version of AIDS.gov located on the test administrator’s laptop. Two laptops using Morae software captured the participant’s face, comments, navigation choices and the data logger’s notes. The test administrator and data logger were present in the testing room. The session captured each participant’s navigational choices, task completion rates, comments, overall satisfaction ratings, questions and feedback. 

## Methodology
Sessions
[Describe how the participants were recruited. Describe the individual sessions – length of time and what happened during those sessions. Explain what the participant was asked to do and what happened post test session. Describe any pre- or post-test questionnaires. Include the subjective and overall questionnaires in the attachments’ section.]

For example: 
The test administrator contacted and recruited participants via AIDS.gov from the HPLA conference attendee list. The test administrator sent e-mails to attendees informing them of the test logistics and requesting their availability and participation. Participants responded with an appropriate date and time. 
Each individual session lasted approximately one hour. During the session, the test administrator explained the test session and asked the participant to fill out a brief background questionnaire (see Attachment A). Participants read the task scenarios and tried to find the information on the website. 

After each task, the administrator asked the participant to rate the interface on a 5-point Likert Scale with measures ranging from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. Post-task scenario subjective measures included (see Attachment B): 
•	How easy it was to find the information from the home page.
•	Ability to keep track of their location in the website.
•	Accurateness of predicting which section of the website contained the information.

After the last task was completed, the test administrator asked the participant to rate the website overall by using a 5-point Likert scale (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree) for eight subjective measures including:
•	Ease of use
•	Frequency of use
•	Difficulty to keep track of location in website
•	Learn ability  - how easy it would be for most users to learn to use the website
•	Information facilitation – how quickly participant could find information
•	Look & feel appeal – homepage’s content makes me want to explore the site further
•	Site content – site’s content would keep me coming back 
•	Site organization

In addition, the test administrator asked the participants the following overall website questions:
•	What the participant liked most.
•	What the participant liked least.
•	Recommendations for improvement. 

See Attachment C for the subjective and overall questionnaires.
