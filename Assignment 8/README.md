### Introduction: a brief introduction about the project. 
The project draws from delish.com and tries to create and implement improvements that would make the site easier to use and stand out amongst competitors.
### Clear design statement: 
Some issues with the site were that:

1. The relevant buttons, like the menu are not where you would expect at first. When you load into the site, the menu button is at the bottom left and moves to the top right on scroll down.
2. Consistency is pretty bad, theres a 2x2 picture menu, followed by 1 big picture, followed by a 1x4 picture menu, followed by 2 medium pictures, seemingly for no reason.
3. The figure ground contrast is iffy, the plain white background and the edge of the picture blend together a bit, not awful but a little weird.

### Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
After conducting the heuristic evaluation my issues with the website were that: the websites user control, aesthetic design, and consistency were lacking. Some fixes seemed to be adding filters and a consistent menu button.

Upon conducting usabililty testing I found that users had trouble finding specific dishes as well as generally navigating the website.

###  User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
In order to get a feel for how people use the internet I conducted a contextual inquiry. The main takeaway is how and when users decide to extract specific information on top of already given info. [read more...](https://github.com/arkaba/DH110-Adam-Kaba/tree/main/Assignment%203)
###  UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
In order to better plan out my project I created 2 user personas. 

#### Persona 1 - Jake
![Persona 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54642348/116467420-7f1f9f80-a824-11eb-91e0-6ac25a7bea91.jpg)

#### First Scenario
Jake is a sophomore in college and he loves watching cooking videos and he's always wanted to try his hand at it. After Jake decides to try cooking, he tries making some of the dishes he sees online. Only to find that most of the recipes he finds are far from beginner friendly, not to mention take a long time to cook. He finds a website called Delish, that has many recipes for many unique dishes that he would love to try cooking one day. However he had been to the site before and wasn't able to find anything useful, he had tried looking for dishes but was given information on things he didnt care about such as happenings in the middle east.

Some features I implemented that would assist Jake is the implementation of an improved search and more concise menus

#### Persona 2 - Julia

#### Second scenario
Julia is a single mother who wants to find recipes to try for her son, as well as a recipe to impress her friends she takes to the internet. She comes across a site, Delish.com that seems like it would have what she's looking for. However upon accessing the site and browsing meal ideas, shes bombarded with all sorts of information, some relevant but over half of it is irrelevant. She would like a way to scroll through food ideas and remove certain options such as "fish", because her son is alergic and "Martinis" because her son is in 5th grade.

Some features I implemented that would assist Julia are the implementation of search filters.

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment06 + part of 07]

I created 3 different color schemes for variation purposes.

## Screen Designs
