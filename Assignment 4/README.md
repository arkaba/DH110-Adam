## Purpose of Storytelling
The purpose of storytelling in my project is to put myself in a possible users perspective in order to see how they would view the product.  
This helps in the context of the products as putting yourself in a users shoes allows you to make the best possible product for them by analyzing their needs.  
By doing this it helps prevent tunnel vision from the developers side and helps us gain useful insight.  

## Features proposed for UX Design

1. Improved search function & search filters
2. More accesssible menu & Selection filters

#### Jake's Scenario
-Jake's halfway through his sophomore year in college. He's a neuroscience major who aspires to be a brain surgeon one day. In his free time he enjoys hanging out with his friends at his apartment by watching netflix or playing games. When his friends aren't around and he's not watching TV, he spends a lot of time on his phone. He enjoys watching foodie youtube videos of people going to either well- renowned or hole in the wall restaurants and eating food. He also loves cooking channels such as Binging with Babish, he finds it remarkable how much people know about cooking, that they can just experiment to create what they want. Being a long time foodie Jake figures he should take up cooking as it would make him more self sufficient and lead to a healthier lifestyle, all while finding a new hobby.  
  

-After Jake decides to try cooking, he tries making some of the dishes he sees online. Only to find that most of the recipes he finds are far from beginner friendly, not to mention take a long time to cook. He finds a website called Delish, that has many recipes for many unique dishes that he would love to try cooking one day. However he had been to the site before and wasn't able to find anything useful, he had tried looking for dishes but was given information on things he didnt care about such as happenings in the middle east. Upon revisiting the site he decides to try looking for his favorite dish, chicken alfredo. To his surprise, he's able to search for and find a recipe! He feels relieved and excited, as he does like the recipes on the website, however he was never able to find what he was looking for; thanks to the new search function he can find what he wants with ease.

#### Julia Scenario
- Julia is a practicing nurse, she works in the Intensive Care Unit at the County hospital. She loves her job and finds it rewarding, however the hospital is often busy so she often finds her time stretched between home and work. Julia is also asingle mother, she and her ex-husband had divorced a couple years ago and she retained custody. Her son is entering middle school soon and she does everything in her power to give him the best life possible. Her son is a pretty picky eater, and doesn't like a lot of the food she cooks. Julia wants to find meals that her son would like, she thinks he would like things that are "different." Julia also has many friends, at their last outing, she invited them over for brunch sometime. However Julia doesn't really know what she could prepare for them that fits with her busy schedule and is still tasty and modern.
- After Julia determines she wants to find recipes to try for her son, as well as a recipe to impress her friends she takes to the internet. She comes across a site, Delish.com that seems like it would have what she's looking for. However upon accessing the site and browsing meal ideas, shes bombarded with all sorts of information, some relevant but over half of it is irrelevant. She would like a way to scroll through food ideas and remove certain options such as "fish", because her son is alergic and "Martinis" because her son is in 5th grade. Julia would also like a way to see how many people each dish would serve in order to gauge what she can serve to her friends. She comes back the next day, and lucky for her the site now includes filters, so she can get rid of information she isn't looking for. Each dish now has a serving size next to it, and better yet there is now a clear menu option for  "Recipies for large groups/guests." Julia is now excited at the prospect of trying out these recipes, her son might like the food and she'll impress her friends! Julia plans to come back to this site in the future.
